## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password storage with hashing
- RESTful API design

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user information.
- **Maven**: Dependency management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mevizcode/Authentication-Authorization-Workflow-with-Spring-Boot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Authentication-Authorization-Workflow-with-Spring-Boot
   ```

3. Update the application properties to configure your database connection:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

4. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

### Example API Calls

- **Register a User**
  ```http
  POST /api/auth/register
  ```

- **Login a User**
  ```http
  POST /api/auth/login
  ```

## API Endpoints
